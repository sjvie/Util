# General Guidelines

- Keep explanations and general text output concise and to the point.
- Refrain from creating additional markdown file summaries unless asked to do so.
- When instructions are unclear and the intent is ambiguous, ask for clarification instead of making assumptions.
- Make informed decisions: Use up-to-date documentation and context7 when necessary.
